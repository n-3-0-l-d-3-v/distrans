# DISTRANS — THE WIRE

> Reliable transport built over a deliberately hostile, unordered, lossy channel.

## Why "DISTRANS"

An actual in-universe device: a coded transmitter (often implanted in a bat) used to carry distorted messages across distance through a channel that is inherently hard to intercept and easy to lose. That is the exact job of this component — build something reliable and legible on top of a channel that offers no guarantees.

Part of **[ARRAKIS](https://github.com/n-3-0-l-d-3-v/arrakis)** — a constrained computing
ecosystem built by removing assumptions ordinary computers depend on. This
repository is developed standalone and mirrored into the combined ecosystem
repo commit-for-commit.

## Status

**Phase 5 — QUEUED**

See [tickets/](tickets/) for the live phase-by-phase ticket board and
[docs/design/](docs/design/) for constraints, invariants and architecture
decision records.

## The constraint

The underlying channel provides no ordering, no reliable delivery, no framing, no integrity, and duplicates or corrupts datagrams. All of that must be built at this layer.

## What the constraint forces

Framing, checksums/integrity, sequence numbers, ACKs, retransmission, selective repeat, flow control, and RPC with idempotency.

## Research question

> How much of TCP's design is forced by physics versus by historical convention?

## Development

This is a real, tested, benchmarked systems component — not a demo. See
[docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md](docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md) for the acceptance
bar every piece of this repo must clear before it is considered complete.

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
cargo bench
```
